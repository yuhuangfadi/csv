`League\Csv` is a simple library to ease CSV parsing, writing and filtering in
PHP. The goal of the library is to be as powerful while remaining lightweight,
by utilizing PHP native classes whenever possible.

`League\Csv` was designed for developers who want to deal with CSV data using
modern code and without the high levels of bootstrap and low-levels of
usefulness provided by existing core functions or third party-code.
