# Upgrading

Welcome to the upgrade guide for `Csv`. We've tried to cover all backward compatible breaks from 5.0 through to the current MAJOR stable release. If we've missed anything, feel free to create an issue, or send a pull request. You can also refer to the information found in the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/thephpleague/csv/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) file attached to the library.
